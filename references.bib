	abstract = {{PyHMMER} provides Python integration of the popular profile Hidden Markov Model software {HMMER} via Cython bindings. This allows the annotation of protein sequences with profile {HMMs} and building new ones directly with Python. {PyHMMER} increases flexibility of use, allowing creating queries directly from Python code, launching searches, and obtaining results without I/O, or accessing previously unavailable statistics like uncorrected P-values. A new parallelization model greatly improves performance when running multithreaded searches, while producing the exact same results as {HMMER}.{PyHMMER} supports all modern Python versions (Python 3.6+) and similar platforms as {HMMER} (x86 or {PowerPC} {UNIX} systems). Pre-compiled packages are released via {PyPI} (https://pypi.org/project/pyhmmer/) and Bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/pyhmmer). The {PyHMMER} source code is available under the terms of the open-source {MIT} licence and hosted on {GitHub} (https://github.com/althonos/pyhmmer); its documentation is available on {ReadTheDocs} (https://pyhmmer.readthedocs.io).},
