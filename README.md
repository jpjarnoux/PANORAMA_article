# Panorama: A robust pangenome-based method for predicting and comparing biological systems across species

## About the project

PANORAMA is an innovative pangenomic tool designed to exploit pangenome graphs and enable them to be annotated and 
compared in order to explore the genomic diversity of several species. Based on the **PPanGGOLiN software suite**¹
([https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN](https://github.com/labgem/PPanGGOLiN)), PANORAMA integrates advanced methods for 
rule-based prediction of macromolecular systems and comparative analysis of conserved features between different 
pangenomes, such as hotspots of insertion. We illustrate the use of PANORAMA on a *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* dataset, 
evaluating its performance against reference defense system prediction tools such as PADLOC² and DefenseFinder³. 
The analysis was then extended to a larger set including four species of Enterobacteriaceae (>6,000 genomes),
demonstrating PANORAMA's ability to annotate, compare and explore the diversity and distribution of biological systems 
across multiple species. This work provides new methods for the large-scale comparative study of microbial genomes and 
underlines the relevance of pangenome approaches in deciphering their evolutionary dynamics. 
PANORAMA is freely available and accessible through:
